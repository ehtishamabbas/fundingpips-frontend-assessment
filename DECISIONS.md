# Technical Decisions & Trade-offs

## What trade-offs did you make and why?

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Framework Choice: Next.js 15 with App Router

**Decision**: Used Next.js 15 with the new App Router and React Server Components.

**Rationale**:
- App Router provides better performance with RSCs
- Built-in optimizations for SEO and performance
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Server-side rendering capabilities for better initial load times

**Trade-offs**:
- Learning curve for RSCs vs traditional React components

### 2. State Management: Zustand

**Decision**: Chose Zustand over Redux Toolkit or React Context.

**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and simple API
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Built-in persistence middleware
- Less boilerplate than Redux
- Better performance than Context for frequent updates

**Trade-offs**:
- Less ecosystem tooling compared to Redux
- Might need additional libraries for complex state logic

### 3. Real-time Updates: Polling Strategy

**Decision**: Implemented polling-based real-time updates instead of WebSockets.

**Rationale**:
- Simpler implementation and debugging
- Better compatibility with serverless deployments

**Trade-offs**:
- Higher resource usage compared to WebSockets

### 4. Component Architecture: RSC + Client Component Boundaries

**Decision**: Strategic use of Server Components for data fetching with Client Components for interactivity.

**Implementation**:
- Search results and stock details: Server Components where possible
- Interactive elements (search input, watchlist): Client Components

**Rationale**:
- Reduces JavaScript bundle size
- Better SEO and initial page load
- Maintains interactivity where needed

## What Would I Do With More Time?

### 1. Enhanced Real-time Features
- WebSocket implementation for true real-time updates
- Price alerts and notifications
- More granular update intervals

### 2. Advanced Charting 
- Multiple timeframes (1D, 1W, 1M, 1Y)
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Moving Averages)
- Candlestick charts

### 3. Authentication & Personalization 
- User accounts
- Personal portfolios with P&L tracking
- Custom alerts and notifications

### 4. Real Data Integration
- Alpha Vantage API integration
- Error handling for rate limits

## Scaling for Real Users

### Infrastructure

**Database Layer**:
- Add PostgreSQL for user data and preferences
- Redis for caching frequently accessed stock data

**API Architecture**:
- API key management
- Background job processing for data updates
- Multiple data provider integration for redundancy

**Caching Strategy**:
- Redis cluster for application caching

### User Experience

**Onboarding**:
- Interactive tutorial for new users
- Progressive feature disclosure

**Personalization**:
- AI-powered stock recommendations
- Customizable dashboard layouts
- Industry-specific views and filters
